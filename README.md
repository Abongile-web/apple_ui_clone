# apple_ui_clone
A responsive website cloning the UI of the apple website (South Africa) using HTML, SCSS and Javascript

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to take any given design and develop an identical 
application.

Custom Html and Css is used to showcase my knowledge of the technologies without requiring any library. Sass is used for features such as mixin's and nesting to allow for a smoother workflow and helps to keep things organized while also allowing me to create stylesheets faster. Media queries are used to ensure the websites responsiveness. Vanilla javascript is also used to add some basic functionalty such as implementing a hamburger navigation for the mobile view.
