# apple_ui_clone
A responsive website cloning the UI of the apple website using HTML, SCSS and Javascript

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to demontrate my ability to take any given design and develop an identical 
application.

Custom Html and Css is used to showcase my knowledge of the technologies without requiring any library. Media queries are used to ensure the websites responsiveness. 
Vanilla javascript is also used to add some basic functionalty such as implementing a hamburger navigation for the mobile view.
